# Day One:

## Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to C**
   - Learned about the origin of the C programming language.
   - Discussed its relevance and why it's important to learn.
   - Explored its influence on other programming languages.

2. **Key Features of C**
   - Low-level access to memory.
   - portability across different platforms.
   - Rich library support and built-in functions.
   - Simple syntax.
   - Imperative and procedural programming.
   - Supports structured programming concepts.

3. **C uses and applications**
   - System programming e.g. operating systems, drivers, etc.
   - Game development.
   - Embedded systems.
   - Compiler and interpreter design.

## Practical Work
- **Wrote a Hello World program in C**
   -Purpose: To understand the basic structure of a C program and the process of compilation and execution.
   - **Key Learnings:**
     - Syntax: The importance of including `stdio.h` for input/output functions.
     - Main function: The starting point of every C program.
     - Return value: The role of `return 0;` in signaling successful execution.

# Day Two:

## Topics covered
1. **Variables in C**
   - Learned and understood the concept of variables as placeholders for data.
   - Explored how to declare variables using appropriate data types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`).
   - Understood how to initialize variables with values.
   - Practiced printing the contents of variables using `printf`.

2. **Key Features of Variables**
   - Data Storage: Variables allow you to store data that can be used and modified during program execution.
   - Data Types: Each variable has a specific data type (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`) that determines the type of data it can hold.
   - Declaration: Variables must be declared before use, specifying the data type and optionally assigning an initial value.
   - Initialization: Assigning a value to a variable at the time of declaration.
   - Memory Allocation: When declared, variables are allocated memory in the system to hold their data.
   - Scope: Variables have a specific scope (local or global) that determines where they can be accessed in the program.

3. **Uses and Applications of Variables**
   - Storing Data: Variables are used to store user inputs, intermediate computations, and final results.
   - Dynamic Changes: Enable programs to adapt dynamically by allowing values to change during execution.
   - Control Logic: Variables are often involved in loops, conditional statements, and logic controls.
   - Mathematical Operations: Perform arithmetic and logical operations using variables as operands.
   - Data Sharing: Facilitate data transfer between different parts of a program.
   - Interactive Programs: Handle user inputs and display outputs effectively.

## Practical Work
   - Wrote a program declaring and intializing a variable of 'int' data type.
   - Declared multiple variables in a single line of code.
   - Initialized multiple variables in a single line of code.


# Day Three:

## Topics covered:
1. **Variable naming conventions**
   - Learnt about the guidelines for variable naming.
   - Understood why variables should be named properly.
   - Learnt specific conventions for variable names.
  
2. **Basic output function - printf**
   - Learnt and understood the purpose of the `printf` function.
   - grasped its basic syntax.
   - Learnt about the different format specifiers.
   - learnt about escape sequences. 
  
## Practical Work:
   - Wrote and executed a program utilizing what I've learned about the `printf` function.
   - Incorporated a basic math equation in C into my function.
   - Made use of a format specifier.
   - made use of strings to print a string constant.
